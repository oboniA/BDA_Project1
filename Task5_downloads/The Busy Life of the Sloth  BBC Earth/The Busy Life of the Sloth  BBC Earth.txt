this extraordinary creature is half blind half death and this is just about as fast as it can move that's what's gonna happen to you if you live on nothing but leaves it's a slice it's not exactly an enthusiastic Leaf eater a couple of half-hearted chews and the leaves go straight down to its stomach leave however or not easily digested the slave technique is to give them time then eventually this mobile compost heap pulls itself together and start on a long and dangerous journey this is a very unusual sight a sloth in a hurry it once to defecate and the only place it's happy doing that oddly enough is down on the ground it's only does it about once a week but why does it come down to the ground to do it and why does it nearly always choose to do so in exactly the same place whatever the reason it must be very important for a stroke on the ground is almost helpless any Predators could attack it and it doesn't have the speed to escape why it comes down in this way is a mystery no bananas now it's finished and back he goes up to the safety of the canopy leaves are not very nutritious the slowest way of compensating for that is not to eat more but to do less it's Klaus hook over the branches so that the Sloth can hang without any effort of its muscles which have been reduced to thin Ribbons and to save energy it spends most of its time hanging around half asleep in the Treetops so with very little muscle and the reaction time only a quarter as fast as ours how does a slopes day compared with are there in the time it takes me to write a few letters the slowest just about managers to groom itself while we have our lunch the Sloth levels of few leaves and then as we found the sequence for the series it's time for another nap
