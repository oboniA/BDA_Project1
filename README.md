CineSence: Big Data Analytics 2024 Project 1 

CineSense is an innovative video-processing startup that extracts valuable insights from social media video 
content. It uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision techniques to analyse 
videos' sentiments and emotions. This analysis is crucial for businesses seeking to understand their 
audience, improve customer experiences, and make data-driven decisions.

Aassigned a critical project: 
find the best strategy to download and analyse videos. CineSense uses YouTube videos posted by its target audience. 
Each video must be analysed, and results should be extracted and shared with customers. Usual tasks 
include extracting video, audio, transcripts, sentiments, and emotions. Also need to transcribe videos in Spanish.

Thanks to Python, we can showcase your skills and automate the tasks. We need a strategy to complete tasks faster! 
Parallel processing concepts can help you speed up the analysis tasks. A project description 
(part 1) and a set of skeleton scripts for  developments provided (part 2) in the PDF.
