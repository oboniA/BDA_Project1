ok so in today's video we are going to talk about percentage increases for example increasing 600 by 25% there are a number of ways to do this but first of all we really have to understand what percentages are presenters are similar to fractions as you can think of percentages as how much of the number you have just like with fractions were 100% of a number is the full number for example 50% of 600 is 300 which is the same as 1/2 of 600 as you can think of 50% as half of 100% or half of the full number just like with fractions you can also have percentages more than 100 for example 125% which is the full number the 100% and another quarter of the number the 25% so now that we have percentages sorted let's take a look at percentage increases an example question may be increase 600 by 25% so to do this we need to take the original 100% the full number and add the 25% which is a quarter 1/4 of 600 is 150 so 600 the original 100% + 150 which is the 25% of the quarter is 750 which is the answer however this can also be solved by dividing 600 by 100 to find what 1% is and then multiplying this 1% by 125 to find 125% although by far the easiest way is simply multiplying by 1.25 this is essentially multiplying the number by 1 and 1/4 which as we have just seen is 125% as 100% is the full number and 25% is a quarter of it this idea can then be used for any percentage increase for example if we increase 600 by 125% we can just multiply 600 by 2.25 as you are finding one itself and then another 1.25 the 125 percent increase ok I hope you enjoyed today's video if you did don't forget to like subscribe and check out class Ninjas for loads more maths resources
