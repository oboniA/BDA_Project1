hello and welcome today we're diving into one of the most mysterious and fascinating phenomena in the universe black holes in space paradoxes let's explore what makes them so mind bending imagine a star that's run out of fuel when a massive star reaches the end of its life it can collapse under its own gravity this collapse creates a region where gravity is incredibly strong pulling everything nearby inward in a black hole gravity becomes insanely intense it's like a cosmic vacuum cleaner sucking in everything around it even light this is why we call it a black hole because even light can't escape its grasp black holes come in different sizes some are small like a few times the mass of our sun while others are super massive with millions or even billions of times the sun's Mass at the centre of a black hole lies the singularity a point where matter is crushed to infinite density the event Horizon is a boundary around a black hole once something crosses this boundary it's trapped forever not even light can escape which is why we can't see black holes directly near a black hole time itself gets warped this is called time dilation imagine if you are near a black hole time would pass differently for you then for someone far away it's like a giant cosmic clock that ticks at different rates now here's where it gets really mind bending black holes seem to break a fundamental rule of Physics the conservation of information when something falls into a black hole it's gone right but according to quantum mechanics information should never be lost this is the information paradox so there you have it black holes nature's ultimate paradoxes they challenge our understanding of the Universe and continue to inspire scientists and science fiction alike thank you for joining us on this cosmic journey make sure to subscribe for more amazing content
