in the punishing cold of an arctic mountains in the remote valard Islands at doorway leads to what meant to be the safest place on Earth scientists are on their way approaching through this isolated and hostile terrain and I'm with them as they carry a precious cargo of seeds to be kept out of the way of whatever climate change might bring how often do you get these deliveries as we have delivered three times a year the box of seeds is about to go through the first line of security there are half a dozen in all I've just come down the access tunnel that's cut into the mountain here this place is 130 m above sea level because if the worst happens in global warming melts all of the Polar Ice caps this project will still be safe ok this is the next stage the deeper inside the mountains we go the more the temperature drops the store is designed to survive any natural disaster for a very long time it depends on what crop it is but some of the crops may survive for more than 4000 years you're really imagining this place functioning keeping the seeds safe for 4000 years what is difficult to say I'm sure that the Pharaohs thought that their pyramids would last long and they did the last barrier to the store itself inside here it's minus 18 Celsius the rows of shelves are filling up with seeds from all over the world there are samples of nearly half of the most important food crops brought here just in case samples of seeds used to be held in glass test tubes now they're kept in little plastic packets and there are more than 800000 of these in this fault and everywhere you look there are examples of why this place matters there are seeds from Syria plants that are good at coping with drought and some have just been returned to the Middle East when harvest to ruined by extremes of weather having backup copies of key seeds as essential another threat is flooding which can damage national stores of seeds this happened in the Philippines and with industrial scale farming most food comes from just a dozen varieties of plants so keeping different genetic types helps to guarantee supplies it is for the survival mankind in the future I mean we need the diversity all the different kinds of France material to get food for the future we have a lot of problems seeing us now climate change environmental problems and to tackle that we need urinating variation so in these remote mountains this place is meant to be a safeguard against apocalypse and insurance policy for a warming world David truckman BBC news in Salvador
